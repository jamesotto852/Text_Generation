\title[Application of RNNs to Text Generation]{Text Generation with RNNs}

\author{James Otto}

\frame{\titlepage}

\section{Introduction}
\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are networks that make one step ahead predictions based on sequential inputs
  \item Information from previous inputs is preserved in the network's "memory" which is maintained via transferring information in hidden layers between sequential predictions
  \item RNNs can be used to predict arbitrarily long continuations of sequences by treating predictions as new data
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
  \item We are going to consider the use of RNNs in language modeling
  \item If we treat text as sequences of characters, we can generate text by making predictions with RNNs
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{The Goal}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
  \item It is a common tactic to train a network on sequences of length $k$ and pad
  inputs with whitespace to be of length $k$ for predictions on "seeds" of arbitrary lengths
  \begin{itemize}
    \item We believe this may have adverse effects on a network's predictions,
    padded seeds do not resemble training observations
  \end{itemize}
  \item We will train several networks, of lengths 1, 5, 10, and 30
  and "bootstrap" prediction process
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This avoids the necessity of padding!
  \end{itemize}
  \item While we are considering the specific application of character generation,
  the idea of bootstrapping via several models trained on sequences of increasing
  lengths generalizes to other applications of RNNs as well
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{The Data}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Our data comes from Project Gutenberg, a digital library which provides public domain books in plain text
  \item We will use several author's works:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Jane Austen
    \item Merry Shelley
    \item Miguel de Cervantes
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
